### About

Students use matlab and simulink to simulate a DAQ system with various parameters.

## 2) Getting Started With the Arduino

### Purpose

To learn about how the Arduino works and getting students to write simple programs and measure from a simple sensor.

### About

Students are given Arduino kit and are led through a series of tutorials for getting started and setting things up.
Students will also learn to write a short program and display sensor data.

## 3) Temperature Lab

### Purpose

To learn about how three different types of temperature sensors work while also learning about amplifiers and circuit building.

### About

Students create a wiring schematic and wire up three types of temperature sensors and measure boiling and ice water.

## 4) Strain Gauge Lab

### Purpose

To learn about how to interface with strain gauges with a wheatstone bridge as well as amplifiers.

### About

Students hook up and write a program to convert strain gauge measurements to force.

## 5) Digital Sensors and Communication

### Purpose

To learn about I2C and SPI and how to hook up and read/set data from sensors that utilize these protocols.
Learn about pros and cons.

### About

Students are given various digital sensors and are asked to hook them up and display data coming from there sensors using digital means.
